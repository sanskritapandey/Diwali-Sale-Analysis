# Diwali Sales Analysis Using Python

## Overview
Data Analysis, also known as _Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)_, is a core component of data science. This repository demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis methods and techniques** using Python on a **Diwali Sales dataset** from Kaggle.

## Project Description
The project includes the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn Libraries
- **Improving customer experience** by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups
- **Enhancing sales** by identifying the most selling product categories and products to optimize inventory management and meet demands

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed that the following group is _more likely to purchase_ products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories:

- **Married women**
- **Age group**: 26-35 years
- **Location**: UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka
- **Occupation**: IT, Healthcare, and Aviation

## Importance of EDA
_Exploratory Data Analysis_ is crucial in the field of data science, often consuming the majority of a data scientist's time. This project serves as a **stepping stone for those interested in this fascinating field**.

## Dataset
The **Diwali Sales dataset** used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It provides an ideal foundation for performing EDA and gaining insights into sales patterns during the Diwali festival season.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install the required dependencies**
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook** containing the analysis
4. **Run the cells/script** to reproduce the analysis
